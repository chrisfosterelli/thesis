\section{Conclusion}
In this section we introduced the collection experiment, in which participants 
performed a reinforcement learning task designed to emulate language learning.
With data from these 25 participants we performed standard EEG preprocessing 
techniques. The preprocessed data from these participants is provided to a model
which correlates the EEG data with semantic word vectors by building a set of 
machine learning models that can be used to predict word vectors for unseen 
words.

We also introduced the \tvt test, which is used to test and statistically 
validate whether or not the model could learn a mapping from the data. In the 
following chapter we will introduce the experiments that we perform on the 
model so we could learn more about how the brain processes language.
