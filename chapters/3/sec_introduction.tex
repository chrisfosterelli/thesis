\section{Introduction}

We begin by describing the collection methodology and the task performed by the participants, followed by a detailed definition of the machine learning semantic representation model and evaluation framework. Lastly, we describe the six experiments we used to detect semantic representations in the brain, measure participant learning, and validate our framework through comparison with other methods.
