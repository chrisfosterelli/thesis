\section{Introduction}

This research shows that it is possible to use EEG to track the emergence of 
semantic mappings in participants during an artificial language learning task. 
This methodology adapts an existing semantic analysis approach based on machine 
learning and applies it to an EEG-based reinforcement learning experiment 
paradigm. This allows us to model the development of semantic mappings. In this 
chapter we begin by describing the collection methodology and the task 
performed by the participants, followed by a detailed definition of the machine 
learning semantic representation model and evaluation framework. The model that 
we use attempts to find a mapping between the EEG data and semantic word 
vectors used in computational linguistics. If the model is able to detect a 
relationship, it will be detected by in a statistical test known as the \tvt 
test. Lastly, we describe the statistical methods used to validate our results 
and summarize the methodology.
