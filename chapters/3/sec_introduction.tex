\section{Introduction}

We begin by describing the collection methodology and the task performed by the participants, followed by a detailed definition of the machine learning semantic representation model and evaluation framework. The model that we use attempts to find a mapping between the EEG data and semantic word vectors used in computational linguistics. If the model is able to detect a relationship, it will be represented in a statistical test known as the \tvt test. Lastly, we describe the statistical methods used to validate our results and summarize the methodology.
