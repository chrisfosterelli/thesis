\section{Participant Performance Experiment}
Reward positivity correlates to participant learning as measured by behavioral feedback, so we also validate our measurement using participant responses during the paradigm. Recall that we recorded the participants' behavioral responses as they learned to map the symbols to English words. Participants with higher behavioral accuracy learn the symbol mapping faster, and should therefore have a stronger representation of the associated word semantics. As in the the Reward Positivity Experiment (Section ~\ref{sec:experiments:rewpos}), this could provide evidence that we are able to detect participant learning, and even quantify the efficacy of learning. We hypothesized that the behavioral accuracy of the participants should be correlated to the average \tvt accuracy for subjects grouped by behavioral accuracy.

To combat the noise inherent in EEG, the \tvt accuracy was calculated over the average of several participants. Here we considered two groups: those 7 participants with the highest and the lowest behavioral accuracies. We calculated \tvt accuracy over these two groups, and compared the groups' average task accuracies. We hypothesized the \tvt accuracy and behavioral accuracy should be positively correlated.
