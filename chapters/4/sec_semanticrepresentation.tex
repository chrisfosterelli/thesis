\section{Semantic Representation Experiment}
\label{sec:experiments:semanticrepresentation}
When the participants initially viewed the symbols, they did not know the English equivalent. But, as they learned the symbol mapping through trial and error, semantic understanding developed. Our methodology allows us to test if word semantics are correlated to EEG activity while viewing the corresponding symbol, and this first experiment is the simplest test of the methodology. We hypothesized that we would see statistically significant accuracy when training on trials after learning is assumed to have occurred.

For each participant, we removed symbols that were presented less than six times to that participant, and removed the first two exposures of each symbol for each participant (as we can assume the symbols were not associated with a semantic meaning in the first two trials). The parameters for trial selection (two and six) provide a balance between allowing the participant time to learn the word, while also retaining enough data to train our model. We cut trials to 700 ms in length, and averaged the remaining exposures over all participants for each word, which gave us a single noise-reduced exposure per word. This data was used to train regression models and perform the \tvt test.
