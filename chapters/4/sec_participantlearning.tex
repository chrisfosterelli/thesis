\section{Participant Learning Experiment}
\label{sec:experiments:participantlearning}
The previous experiment allowed us to detect if semantic representation of learned symbols could be detected using EEG.  We then tested \emph{when} we can detect the semantic mapping, as a function of the number of exposures. Here we determined if we can detect the average onset of symbol learning. We compared the \tvt accuracy for the earlier trials (e.g. trials 1-3, before the symbol meaning was learned) to the later trials (e.g. trails 4-6, after participant learning) to test if we can measure the emergence of semantics during the paradigm. As in Section~\ref{sec:experiments:semanticrepresentation}, we only considered participant-word pairs with six or more exposures. We compared the \tvt accuracy of averaged overlapping subsets of three exposures, selected from the first six exposures. We hypothesized that the \tvt accuracy would increase in later exposures, as the symbol mapping was learned by the participants.
