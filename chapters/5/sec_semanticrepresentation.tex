\section{Semantic Representation Experiment}

This first experiment, the Semantic Representation Experiment, was designed to 
determine whether we could identify semantics in EEG under this reinforcement 
learning paradigm. We utilize a similar approach that has detected semantic 
representations successfully in fMRI and MEG. Here, we trained our model on a 
subset of the trials where we anticipated participant learning would have 
occurred, and evaluated this model with the 2 vs 2 test. 

Our model produced a 2 vs 2 accuracy of \textbf{79.54\%} for the 0 - 700 ms 
window which is statistically above chance with $p < 0.001$. For the 0 - 500 ms 
window, the \tvt accuracy is \textbf{69.15\%} which is also statistically above 
chance with $p < 0.001$. This shows we can detect semantic representations in 
the brain using EEG data.  While applying this experiment in this paradigm and 
with this collection methodology has some unique attributes that will be 
further discussed in Section~\ref{sec:discussion:semanticrepresentation}, the 
main value of this experiment is that it provides a baseline validation for 
using this methodology to explore semantic representations with EEG in more 
detail in later experiments.
