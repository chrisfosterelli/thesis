\section{Conclusion}

In this chapter we have described the results found in our experiments. The 
next chapter will explore these in more detail, including the conclusions we 
can draw and an investigation of how our work fits into alignment with existing 
literature. Our early high level analysis of these results shows that it is 
possible to detect the semantic representation of the English words in EEG and 
that we can detect how this semantic representation emerges during learning 
over time. We can also see evidence that our results align with other 
measurements of learning, such as the reward positivity and task accuracy.  
Lastly, when exploring the \tvt accuracy over both time and sensors we see 
interesting spikes both early and late and a distributed source of semantics 
across the human cortex.
