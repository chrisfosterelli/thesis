\subsection{Conclusion}
EEG can be used to detect word semantics, even for a symbol-based artificial language, and even during the process of learning.  EEG is a more noisy brain imaging modality, but even still, we provide evidence that EEG can produce decoding results on par with previous work~\cite{Mitchell2008}. We provided ERP, behavioral, time, and sensor based evidence that our approach models the semantics of the symbol mapping. Our work brings new understanding to the dynamics of semantic representations in the brain, and provides evidence that we can detect semantic representations \emph{as they are learned}.  This hints at several new directions for studying brain function, and the neural underpinnings of learning.  In particular, our work is further evidence that EEG is an effective tool for studying the brain's mechanisms for semantics and learning, and that even fine-grained semantic distinctions can be detected using EEG.
