\label{chapter:discussion}

We have compiled evidence that we can detect semantics and learning using EEG 
with statistically significant accuracy. While previous work has shown that 
learning can be detected via EEG, our work is the first to show that the 
product of that learning (i.e. the semantic representation) can be detected via 
our machine learning methodology, and that it aligns well with more traditional 
ERP-style analyses. Here in this chapter we will explore our results in more 
detail, along with the conclusions we can draw from it.
