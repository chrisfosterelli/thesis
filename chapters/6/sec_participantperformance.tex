\subsection{Comparison with Participant Performance}
In the Participant Performance Experiment, we hypothesized that the task accuracy of participants should be related to the \tvt accuracy. To test this, we took both the top 7 and bottom 7 performing participants (measured in terms of task accuracy) and evaluated the model pipeline with those groups. We found the \tvt accuracy is higher (65.13\% vs 59.71\%) for the group that performed better in terms of task accuracy. Higher task accuracy implies a participant learned the symbol mapping better than a participant with lower task accuracy, and the \tvt results show that this trend is measurable in the EEG data.  However, it should be noted that, because of the set up of our experimental pipeline (in particular, averaging over participant EEG data), we cannot compute a statistical significance score for the difference in \tvt accuracies across the two groups.  Further experimentation would be required to more rigorously test and validate our hypothesis.
