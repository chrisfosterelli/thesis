\section{Conclusion}

Traditional analysis methods for semantic information in the brain consist 
mostly of ERP-based techniques, however machine learning methods have been able 
to provide additional insight over magnitude based visual comparisons. Mitchell 
et al. built on these early methods to create an approach that utilizes 
semantic word vectors generated from a text corpus~\cite{Mitchell2008}. This 
approach models the actual semantics of words rather than learning a mapping 
between the brain data and a category, and introduces the ability to generalize 
to words the model has never been trained on before. 

This work, original in fMRI, was further iterated on when adapted to 
MEG~\cite{Sudre2012}. It has also been expanded to include more complex 
language structures such as sentences and adjective-noun 
phrases~\cite{pereira2018toward, afyshethesis}. Our work builds on these to 
adapt the corpus-based approach from Mitchell et al. and the iterations from 
Sudre et al. to the EEG collection methodology and our reinforcement learning 
based experiment paradigm. With this new paradigm and adapted approach we hope 
to provide insight into the learning process of the brain, something 
traditionally studied by an ERP component known as the reward positivity. The 
following chapter will describe the experiment paradigm, preprocessing 
techniques, and model framework we use in our experiments.
