\section{Larger Language Structures}

While most of the work discussed here focuses on the analysis of single 
concrete nouns, recent work has been done that extends into more complicated 
language structures such as phrases or sentences. 

Chang et al. showed that it is possible to identify adjective-noun phrases with 
classification models utilizing fMRI data, and that vector-based semantic 
models are related to brain activity of participants reading the adjective-noun 
phrases~\cite{Chang2009}. Fyshe showed that a similar computational model based 
on word vectors could also be applied to adjective noun 
phrases~\cite{afyshethesis}.

Pereira et al. adapted the semantic representation model for whole 
sentences~\cite{pereira2018toward}, and covered a much larger semantic variety 
of words than previous work. In our work, we will focus on adapting the single 
word paradigm to EEG. However, with this ground work established in EEG more 
complicated language structures become an obvious area for future 
experimentation.
