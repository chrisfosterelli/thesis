\section{Contributions}

Many people were involved in the making of this research. Additionally, much of 
this research has been published or submitted for consideration at a publisher.  
This thesis will therefore include components which have been published or were 
done by other researchers. This section will outline the contributions of 
everyone and any relevant publications (pending or otherwise), so no work is 
misrepresented.

Chad C. Williams, Dr. Olav E. Krigolson, and others from the Neuroeconomics Lab 
at the University of Victoria collected the data for this thesis and performed 
the EEG preprocessing in coordination with us. Chad performed the reward 
positivity analysis on the data as well. Their EEG expertise was invaluable 
through many components of the project. The word vectors for this thesis were 
provided by wordvectors.org and trained by Mikolov et al.~\cite{Mikolov2013}.  

An early version of the work in this thesis was published at the Inaugural 
Conference on Cognitive Computational Neuroscience. A complete version of the 
work in this thesis has been submitted for consideration at the journal 
NeuroImage.
