\section{Contributions}

As with all good science, many people were involved in the making of this 
research. Additionally, much of this research has been published or submitted 
for consideration at a publisher. This thesis will therefore include components 
which have been published or were done by other researchers. This section will 
outline the contributions of everyone and any relevant publications (pending or 
otherwise), so no work is misrepresented.

Chad X, Dr. Olav X, and others from the Neuroeconomics Lab at the University of 
Victoria collected the data for this thesis and performed the EEG preprocessing 
in coordination with us. Chad X performed the reward positivity analysis on the 
data as well. Their EEG expertise was invaluable through many components of the 
project. The word vectors for this thesis were trained by wordvectors.org. The 
work in Appendix A was done in equal collaboration with Dhanush X, Ed X, and 
with menorship from Dr. George X. The work in Appendix B was largely completed 
by Dhanush X, while our contribution was the adversarial component of the 
research. Throughout the entirety of the novel research described in this 
document Dr. Alona Fyshe provided continueing mentoring, guidance, feedback, 
and ideas.

An early version of the work in this thesis was published at the Conference on 
Computational Congnitive Neuroscience. A complete version of the work in this 
thesis has been submitted for consideration at the journal of NeuroImage.  
Appendix A is pending publication at MMSP2018. Appendix B has been submitted 
for consideration at the conference for Neural Information Processing Systems.
