\section{Connected Work}

In addition to the core topics in this thesis, other research projects that are 
related to the topic of semantic representation in the brain were studied and 
not directly included in the main text for this thesis. However, because of 
their connection to the core topic, they have been included as appendices here.

Appendix A describes the work related to the study of the representation of 
music in the human brain. This research similarly explores the application of 
EEG for representation research in the human brain, and utilizes a similar 
approach here. Instead of a language learning task, subjects listen to various 
clips of music while EEG data is recorded. We were able to detect a similar 
relationships between the EEG and audio vectors that we generate as we do in 
this research with EEG and semantic word vectors.

Appendix B describes the work related to the study of the semantic 
representations in convolutional neural networks. Convolutional neural networks 
are a type of artificial neural network which are highly effective at computer 
vision tasks. Because of their inspiration from the structure of neurons in the 
brain, they make an interesting research area for applying these algorithms.
