\section{Conclusion}

In this chapter we have introduced the high level concepts and research topics 
which will be explored, as well as the technologies and terminologies involved.  
This research shows that semantic representations of the native word can be 
decoded from EEG data when a person views the foreign orthographic form, once 
the participant has successfully learned an artificial language mapping.  We 
use existing methods for detecting semantic representations~\cite{Sudre2012}, 
and apply them in a novel language learning paradigm. We provide supporting 
evidence for this method using event related potential (ERP), behavioral, time, 
and sensor based analysis techniques. In the next chapter, we will detail the 
key background work that we build on in this thesis.
