The study of semantics in the brain explores how the brain represents, 
processes, and learns the meaning of language. In this thesis we show both that 
semantic representations can be decoded from electroencephalography data, and 
that we can detect the emergence of semantic representations as participants 
learn an artificial language mapping. We collected electroencephalography data 
while participants performed a reinforcement learning task that simulates 
learning an artificial language, and then developed a machine learning semantic 
representation model to predict semantics as a word-to-symbol mapping was 
learned. Our results show that 1) we can detect a reward positivity when 
participants correctly identify a symbol's meaning; 2) the reward positivity 
diminishes for subsequent correct trials; 3) we can detect neural correlates of 
the semantic mapping as it is formed; and 4) the localization of the neural 
representations is heavily distributed. Our work shows that language learning 
can be monitored using EEG, and that the semantics of even newly-learned word 
mappings can be detected using EEG.
